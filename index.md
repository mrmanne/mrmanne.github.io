# Erik Mannergren

## About

My name is Erik Mannergren. I'm working as a software developer, based in Gothenburg, Sweden. I have been working in the Telecom business for around 15 years where I have been developing network applications mostly in C and C++. From September 2019 I'm working as a freelance IT consultant. My current assignment is within the Automotive sector where I code C++ and Rust.

I try to do some programming in my spare time. I really like programming quizzes like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) and I sometimes take the opportunity to learn a new language during the event. In recent years I have started to publish my solutions on [github](https://github.com/mrmanne).

I'm also interested in retro gaming and old computers. I had an Amiga 500 when I was a child and I have many good memories from that time. I have longed for buying an Amiga again for many years and I finally bought an Amiga 1200 this year. I plan to do some programming on it when I get time. Hopefully you can find some Amiga projects on my [github account](https://github.com/mrmanne) in the future.

I have also been developing a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator as a hobby project for some time. It's still in early development but I plan to publish it on github when it's getting more complete.
